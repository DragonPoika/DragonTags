# DragonTags
A list of tags for Minecraft Datapacks

**How to use**

1. Download the whole pack or only the tags you want to use
2. (IF you're gonna use it in your own pack/world and didn't download the full pack) Add the ```dtags``` namespace to your datapacks ```data``` folder
3. Add the tags in their respective folders, for example ```#dtags:glass``` would be found as ```dtags:blocks/glass.json``` in your datapack
4. Feel free to use the tags as long as you use them with credit. Make sure you have them in the dtags namespace!

**Questions&Answers**

Q: How do I know the tags are there and nothing's broken?

_- A: The datapack has a reload message that should come when the world is loaded if you downloaded the full pack. If you downloaded only the tag and read the **How to use** you'll be fine. You can also check the log to see if there's something broken._

Q: What's the easiest way to search for item's with the tag?

_- A: In the creative inventory you can go to ```Search``` and type for example ```#glass``` if you're looking for blocks in the ```#dtags:glass``` tag._

Q: How do I suggest new tags?

_- A: You can do a bug report at https://github.com/DragonPoika/DragonTags/issues . Remember to add a  description for example ```"Includes all glass blocks and panes"``` would be good for ```#dtags:glass```._
