**Questions&Answers**

Q: How do I know the tags are there and nothing's broken?
- A: The datapack has a reload message that should come when the world is loaded. You can also check the log to see if there's something broken.

Q: What's the easiest way to search for item's with the tag?
- A: In the creative inventory you can go to ```Search``` and type for example ```#glass``` if you're looking for blocks in the ```#dtags:glass``` tag. If you wanna clear your inventory from items with ```#dtags:glass``` tag, use ```/clear @s #dtags:glass```.

Q: How do I suggest new tags?
- A: You can do a bug report at https://github.com/DragonPoika/DragonTags/issues . Add the ```new tag``` label to it and it'll be looked into. Remember to tell a description for example ```"Includes all glass blocks and panes"``` would be good for ```#dtags:glass```.
